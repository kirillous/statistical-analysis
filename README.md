# Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing size measurement data related to a specific plant species. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset using various statistical methods.

## Key Analytical Methods

 - Scatter Plots and Correlation Calculations: Used to discern fundamental trends and connections.
 - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Employed for a more thorough interpretation of the dataset's underlying patterns.
 - K-means Algorithm: Utilized to identify distinct groupings within the data, offering potential insights into the plant's size variations.

## Findings

1. Linear Relationships:
 - Variables X1, Y1, and Y2 exhibit strong linear relationships.
 - High correlation coefficients, clear linearity in scatter plots, and clustering of data points around certain lines suggest that some measurements may redundantly capture similar information.
   
2. Distinct Clusters:
 - The presence of distinct clusters within the dataset was observed through multiple analyses.
 - Clear clusters on scatter plots, distinct arrangements in the PCA plot, and successful segmentation into three clusters using the K-means algorithm indicate the existence of three distinct species of plants in the dataset.

## Conclusion 

This analysis provides significant insights into the relationships and structures within the plant size measurement dataset. The findings highlight the importance of careful analysis and interpretation, offering valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes and further research.
